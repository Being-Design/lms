How to Clone a LearnDash Course
In your WordPress admin panel, go to LearnDash LMS -> Courses. The list of courses on your LMS should be displayed. Upon hovering over a course name, you should notice a ‘Clone Course’ option.

Upon clicking this option, the course should be completely cloned along with associated lessons and topics, and you should receive a course successfully cloned notification.

All course content duplicated, is not automatically published, but rather saved as drafts, and categorized the same way as the original content.

It is the same as the Course, but only on the all groups list. The cloned group will maintain all settings that were associated with the original group.
