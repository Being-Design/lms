While ProfileGrid is fundamentally a profile building plugin, it also introduces concept of User Groups. Groups are equivalent to Profile types where you can have different profile structures for different group of users. Advantages of Group based system is apparent from the very beginning:


* You can have multiple Profile types.
* Each Group can have its own set of fields.
* Each Group can have its own Group Leader.
* Group Leader can have special privacy level.
* Each group can have its own registration workflow.
* You can offer visitors option to sign up for Group of their choice.
* Groups can have membership limits.
* Groups can be mapped to a specific WordPress Roles.

And so much more!


If you do not need multiple Groups, there’s nothing stopping you to use the default Group as single profile type.

ProfileGrid is pretty both on the front end AND the dashboard area. We understand you spend a lot of time inside the dashboard, therefore, we made sure the admin facing interface is clean and organized. You will absolutely love it when you first log into ProfileGrid.
